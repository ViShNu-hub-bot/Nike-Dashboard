# Nike Shoes Dashboard

Excited to showcase my latest project - an interactive Power BI dashboard centered around Nike shoes! ðŸ“ŠðŸ‘Ÿ 

## Overview

The dataset, meticulously transformed using Power Query, is sourced from Data World. You can access the dataset [here](https://lnkd.in/gsrj8Z8u). The Power BI file is available on GitHub [here](https://lnkd.in/gKNxYwsK). ðŸš€

## Key Features

- **Power Query Transformations:** This dashboard goes beyond the basics, leveraging the power of Power Query for robust data transformations. From cleaning and structuring the raw dataset to shaping it for meaningful analysis, each step in Power Query contributes to the accuracy and depth of insights. ðŸ’¡

- **DAX Functions Integration:** In addition to Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions have been seamlessly integrated into the dashboard. These functions enhance the analytical capabilities, allowing for complex calculations, trend analysis, and performance metrics. It's not just about data visualization; it's about deriving actionable insights through a combination of Power Query transformations and DAX calculations. ðŸ“ˆðŸ’»

## Get Started
